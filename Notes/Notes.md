# Notes

I'll accumulate various material here for quick reference. (very incomplete as of now)

## Pronouns

These are the words for "I", "you", "we" etc. in all their different forms. For example, "I" can also be in the form "me", "to me", "for me", "from me", "with me". These are called grammatical cases.

## **Unḍu** = "to be"
