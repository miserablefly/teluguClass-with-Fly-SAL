# Notes

I'll accumulate various material here for quick reference. (very incomplete as of now)

## Pronouns

These are the words for "I", "you", "we" etc. in all their different forms. For example, "I" can also be in the form "me", "to me", "for me", "from me", "with me". These are called grammatical cases.

## **Unḍu** = "to be"

The *infinitive form* of the verb "to be" is **unḍaḍam**, and this corresponds to the usage *being* in English. The imperative form (command) is **unḍu**, as in **ikkaḍa unḍu** = "be here!". To make it respectful (request), attach **-anḍi** at the end, to make **unḍandi** = "please be". This is applicable to other verbs too - **čeyyi** = "do" -> **čeyyanḍi** = "please do".

## Question words

Question words in Telugu mostly start with the sounds **e** or **ē**.

| Word      |Meaning|
| ----------|-------|
| **ekkaḍa**    | "where" |
| **eppuḍu**    | "when"  |
