# Notes

I'll accumulate various material here for quick reference. (very incomplete as of now)

## Daily phrases
## Pronouns

These are the words for "I", "you", "we", "it" etc. in all their different forms. For example, "I" can also be in the form "me", "to me", "for me", "from me", "with me". These are called *grammatical cases*. Take the sentence "I am reading his book to you" = **nēnu atani pustakānni nīku chaduvutunnānu**. In this, we have the following pronouns: **nēnu** = "I" (*nominative*), **atani** = "his" (*possessive*), and **nīku** = "to you" (*dative*, indirect object). These are the pronouns in the *nominative*, where they act as the main subject performing the action that the verb indicates. In the above sentence, **nēnu** = "I" is the subject, and not "him" or "you" or someone else.

| 1st  | **nēnu** ("I") | **mēmu**/**manamu** ("we")   |
| 2nd (inf.)   | **nuvvu** ("you", inf.) | **mīru** ("you all")   |
| 2nd (resp.)    | **mīru** ("you", resp.) | **mīru** ("you all")   |
| 3rd (obj.)    | **idi**/**adi** ("this"/"that"/"it") | **ivi**/**avi** ("these"/"those"/"they")   |

## Verbs
### **Unḍu** = "to be"

The *infinitive form* of the verb "to be" is **unḍaḍam**, and this corresponds to the usage *being* in English. The imperative form (command) is **unḍu**, as in **ikkaḍa unḍu** = "be here!". To make it respectful (request), attach **-anḍi** at the end, to make **unḍandi** = "please be". This is applicable to other verbs too - **čeyyi** = "do" -> **čeyyanḍi** = "please do".
