# Notes

I'll accumulate various material here for quick reference. (very incomplete as of now)

## Daily phrases
## Plurals

Most nouns in Telugu form their plurals by adding on **-lu** at the end. The nouns sometimes change slightly when this happens. There are a few exceptions to this rule, and these exceptions themselves follow certain patterns. English nouns or other imported nouns get pluralized similarly.

## Pronouns

These are the words for "I", "you", "we", "it" etc. in all their different forms. For example, "I" can also be in the form "me", "to me", "for me", "from me", "with me". These are called *grammatical cases*. Take the sentence "I am reading his book to you" = **nēnu atani pustakānni nīku chaduvutunnānu**. In this, we have the following pronouns: **nēnu** = "I" (*nominative*), **atani** = "his" (*possessive*), and **nīku** = "to you" (*dative*, indirect object). These are the pronouns in the *nominative*, where they act as the main subject performing the action that the verb indicates. In the above sentence, **nēnu** = "I" is the subject, and not "him" or "you" or someone else.

### Nominative pronouns (subject)

| Person    | Singular | Plural |
| ----------|-------| -------|
| 1st  | **nēnu** ("I") | **mēmu**/**manamu** ("we")   |
| 2nd (inf.)   | **nuvvu** ("you", inf.) | **mīru** ("you all")   |
| 2nd (resp.)    | **mīru** ("you", resp.) | **mīru** ("you all")   |
| 3rd (obj.)    | **idi**/**adi** ("this"/"that"/"it") | **ivi**/**avi** ("these"/"those"/"they")   |
| 3rd (male)    | **atanu**/**ataḍu** ("he", resp. inf.) | **vāḷḷu** ("they", inf.)   |
| 3rd (fem.)    | **āme**/**āviḍa** ("he", resp./inf.) | **vāḷḷu** ("they", inf.)   |
| 3rd (very resp.)    | **vāru** ("he/she", very reps.) | **vāru** ("they", very resp.)   |

## Question words

Question words in Telugu mostly start with the sounds **e** or **ē**.

| Word      |Meaning|
| ----------|-------|
| **ekkaḍa**    | "where" |
| **eppuḍu**    | "when"  |
| **elā**       | "how"   |
| **enṭi**      | "what"  |
| **ēm**        | "what"  |
| **enduku**    | "why"   |
| **enta**      | "how much" |
| **yē**        | "which" |
| **evaru**     | "who"   |

The following are the various forms of the question word **evaru** = "who" in various grammatical cases. These are useful for expressing ideas like "whose", "to whom", "for whom" etc. The endings follow similar patterns as with other pronouns or nouns.

| Forms of **evaru**      |Meaning|
| ----------|-------|
| **evari**     | "whose" (adj.) |
| **evari-*****di***   | "whose" (sing. pron.) |
| **evari-*****vi***  | "whose" (pl. pron.) |
| **evari-*****ni***   | "whom" (dir. obj. *accusative*) |
| **evari-*****ki***   | "to whom" (indir. obj. *dative*) |
| **evari-*****kosam***   | "for whom" |
| **evari-*****nunči***   | "from whom" |
| **evari-*****tō***   | "with whom" |
| **evari-*****valla***   | "because of whom" |

## Verbs
### **Unḍu** = "to be"

The *infinitive form* of the verb "to be" is **unḍaḍam**, and this corresponds to the usage *being* in English. The imperative form (command) is **unḍu**, as in **ikkaḍa unḍu** = "be here!". To make it respectful (request), attach **-anḍi** at the end, to make **unḍandi** = "please be". This is applicable to other verbs too - **čeyyi** = "do" -> **čeyyanḍi** = "please do".
