## [Class 1](https://github.com/miserablefly/teluguClass-with-Fly-SAL/tree/main/Class%201)

In the first class, we did some basic introduction conversation practice. We picked up some basic vocabulary and worked on the pronunciation. We also looked at how Telugu compares with Tamil and Hindi in constructing sentences. 

## [Class 2](https://github.com/miserablefly/teluguClass-with-Fly-SAL/tree/main/Class%202)

The main topic was the verb **unḍu** = "to be". We looked at the *imperative* (commands, requests) and the *present tense* forms. Together with some pronouns like **nēnu** = "I", **mīru** = "you (resp./plur.)" etc., we interactively made some basic sentences using these forms of **unḍu**. In the process, we picked up some useful basic vocabulary like question words - **ekkaḍa** = "where", **eppuḍu** = "when" etc. We also looked at the *near* (**i** sound) and *far* (**a** sound) forms in Telugu, which we will learn for many kinds of words. For example, from the question form **eppuḍu** = "when", we get **ippuḍu** = "now" and **appuḍu** = "then".
