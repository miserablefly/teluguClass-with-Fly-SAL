## [Class 1](https://github.com/miserablefly/teluguClass-with-Fly-SAL/tree/main/Class%201)
21 May 2021  

In the first class, we did some basic introduction conversation practice. We picked up some basic vocabulary and worked on the pronunciation. We also looked at how Telugu compares with Tamil and Hindi in constructing sentences. 

## [Class 2](https://github.com/miserablefly/teluguClass-with-Fly-SAL/tree/main/Class%202)
29 May 2021  

The main topic was the verb **unḍu** = "to be". We looked at the *imperative* (commands, requests) and the *present tense* forms. Together with some pronouns like **nēnu** = "I", **mīru** = "you (resp./plur.)" etc., we interactively made some basic sentences using these forms of **unḍu**. In the process, we picked up some useful basic vocabulary like question words - **ekkaḍa** = "where", **eppuḍu** = "when" etc. We also looked at the *near* (**i** sound) and *far* (**a** sound) forms in Telugu, which we will learn for many kinds of words. For example, from the question form **eppuḍu** = "when", we get **ippuḍu** = "now" and **appuḍu** = "then".

After a quick revision of **unḍu** = "to be" and the triangle of **e**: question, **i**: near, **a**: far, we looked at the verb **cheyyi** = "to do/make". This is a very useful verb that helps us construct many other verbs - either with Telugu nouns like **vanṭa cheyyi** = "to cook", **pani cheyyi** = "to work/function", **tayāru cheyyi** = "to prepare" or with English verbs like **try cheyyi**, **drive cheyyi**, **download cheyyi**. We also took at peek at the main tenses in Telugu and the structure of the verb word - VerbStem-Tense-Person. 

## [Class 4](https://github.com/miserablefly/teluguClass-with-Fly-SAL/tree/main/Class%204)
10 June 2021  

We translated some sentences from English to Telugu, and picked up new words and concepts in the process. We learned how to say (a) "I/you want .." = **nāku/mīku .. kāvāli**, (b) "I/you don't want .." = **nāku/mīku .. oddu**, (c) "Can you .. verb?" = **mīru .. verb galarā?**, and a few other useful constructions.

## [Class 5](https://github.com/miserablefly/teluguClass-with-Fly-SAL/tree/main/Class%205)
16 June 2021  

We translated a few sentences from English to Telugu again.
